            Compartmental models are useful dynamical models widely used in epidemiology to describe the transmission of infectious diseases.
             They divide the population into compartments, which correspond to a state variable that indicates the number of individuals that are in a specific stage of the disease [1]. 
             They also make assumptions about the nature and speed of transmission from one compartment to another in time [2]; 
             and are useful for predicting trends and evaluating control measures [3].
